I manage the contents here using a `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
project. I think it is really awesome.

Also, as you probably can notice at the page footer, I am using the
Bootstrap theme `modified for Sphinx
<https://github.com/scotch/sphinx-bootstrap>`_ by Scotch Media. Great stuff.

And last but not the least, thanks to GitHub for GitHub pages.
