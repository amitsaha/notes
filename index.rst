Amit Saha's Technical Writings

I am a programmer who has deep interest in writing technical
articles. The articles listed here are the ones I have started writing for
this space exclusively. 

The articles which I have written in the past for various magazines
are not linked from here, but are available `here
<http://echorand.me/writings/>`_, if you are interested to take a look.

I manage the contents here using a `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_
project. I think it is really awesome.

Also, as you probably can notice at the page footer, I am using the
Bootstrap theme `modified for Sphinx
<https://github.com/scotch/sphinx-bootstrap>`_ by Scotch Media. Great stuff.

And last but not the least, thanks to GitHub for GitHub pages.
