Assignment statements are copy statements. They store the value of
the variable or the result of the expression on the right hand side 
in the memory location pointed to by the variable on the left hand 
side. 

Any changes to the "original" variable is not reflected in any
other copies of this variable.

this is a no-op statement.
     This is a valid C expression, but there is no visible
     effect of this operation. Unlike Python, data not stored in a
     variable is not stored and hence isn't allocated any memory.
