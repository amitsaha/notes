Python Implementations
----------------------
 
In common parlance, Python is used to refer to Python - the
programming language *and* Python - the compiler freely available from
the official `project website`_. These are obviously two different
things. 

CPython
=======

Python, the *programming language* is exactly what it says - a
programming language. It has a `grammar specification`_, a `data
model`, an `execution model`, etc_. Its a blueprint for the
language. Nothing stops anyone with the necessary knowledge and armed
with the right tools to write his or her own program which will
recognize a program written in Python and execute it. This program
would be called an *implementation* of the Python language. This is
exactly what Python - the compiler available from the project website
is. This implementation is the default (reference) implementation of the Python
programming language and is written in C. Hence, it is also referred
to as `CPython`. Infact, with other production quality Python
implementation existing, it is a good idea to make it a habit to refer
to it as `CPython`, rather than Python to distinguish it from Python,
the programming language.

CPython currently supports both Python 2 and Python 3 language
specifications and is available for Mac OSX, Linux, Windows and other
Unix-es.
 
Now that we know what CPython is, let's look at the other production
quality Python implementations.
